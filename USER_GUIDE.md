## What Can InsightAgent Do?

InsightAgent is an AI assistant that helps you analyze business data. It can:

| Capability | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Query Data** | Ask questions about revenue, sales, customers, and performance |
| **Explain Context** | Get explanations using company knowledge (targets, strategies, definitions) |
| **Remember Conversations** | Picks up where you left off, even in new sessions |

---

## Sample Questions to Try

### 1. Basic Data Query
Ask about company performance:

> **"What was our Q4 2024 revenue?"**

You'll see:
- The AI querying the database (shown in the reasoning panel on the right)
- A response with the revenue figures broken down by region
- Suggested follow-up questions

---

### 2. Understanding Performance
Ask for analysis with context:

> **"Why did we miss our Q4 target?"**

The AI will:
- Query revenue data
- Search company knowledge for targets and strategies
- Explain the shortfall with business context (competitor activity, pricing changes)

---

### 3. Comparing Data
Ask comparative questions:

> **"How does West region compare to last quarter?"**

The AI remembers what you discussed earlier and provides quarter-over-quarter comparison.

---

### 4. Metrics Explained
Ask about business definitions:

> **"Is our churn rate healthy?"**

The AI will:
- Look up your company's churn definition and targets
- Compare current performance to internal benchmarks
- Explain whether performance is on track

---

### 5. Cross-Session Memory
To test memory across sessions:

1. Ask a question (e.g., "What was West region revenue?")
2. Close the browser tab
3. Reopen the app
4. Ask: **"What were we discussing last time?"**

The AI will recall your previous analysis.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - "Q4 2024 revenue" works better than "recent revenue"
2. **Ask follow-ups** - The AI remembers context, so "break that down by region" works after a revenue question
3. **Ask "why"** - The AI excels at explaining trends, not just showing numbers
4. **Use natural language** - No need for technical terms, just ask like you would a colleague
